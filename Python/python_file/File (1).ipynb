    "*********File Handling in Python*******\n",
    "Files are named locations on disk to store related information. \n",
    "They are used to permanently store data in a non-volatile memory \n",
    "(e.g. hard disk).Since Random Access Memory (RAM) is volatile, we use files for future use of the data by permanently storing them.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we want to read from or write to a file, we need to open it first.When we are done, it needs to be closed,so that the resources that are tied with the file are freed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, in Python, a file operation takes place in the following order:\n",
    "Open a file, Read or write (perform operation), Close the file\n",
    "\n",
    "All programs need the input to process and output to display data. \n",
    "And everything needs a file as name storage compartments on computers \n",
    "that are managed by OS. Though variables provide us a way to store \n",
    "data while the program runs, if we want out data to persist even \n",
    "after the termination of the program, we have to save it to a file."
